Taxonomy annotation

Goals:

1. Find groups that are broken up and bring them together
	- Search for all groups that have a particular label (staph)
		if these groups are all separated, identify a node that is a parent of all of
		these groups, call the high level group staph and delete that label from all of
		the smaller groups
