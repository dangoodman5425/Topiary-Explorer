Introduction
============
This tutorial explains how to use TopiaryExplorer, a phylogenetic tree viewing tool.

Current technologies for high-throughput sequencing provide an investigator with massive amounts of data that are most easily interpreted with use of appropriate graphical models. In microbial ecology studies, the use of a phylogenetic tree can provide powerful insight into the structure of microbial hierarchies. 

TopiaryExplorer is an innovative phylogenetic tree-viewing program written in Java that, unlike most phylogenetic tree-viewing software currently available, integrates the tree along with its related metadata. This tree-metadata relationship facilitates easy identification of interesting inferences by way of automated tree coloring. TopiaryExplorer handles tip-related metadata, such as OTU metadata, as well as more generalized group metadata by way of a tip to group table and group metadata, commonly in the form of sample metadata. In addition to automated tip coloring, tips can also be automatically labeled with related metadata. Principal coordinates analysis visualizations are available in the stand-alone, offline version of TopiaryExplorer, and are also colored automatically based on supplied metadata. TopiaryExplorer also features database connectivity, allowing investigators to pull down and combine, edit, search and save metadata from multiple studies. Multiple tree layouts such as rectangular or polar views combined with automated coloring of interesting conclusions can be exported as publication quality PDF images. TopiaryExplorer acts as an analysis pipeline, keeping all phylogenetic tree related information in one place so that data analysis is more interactive and easier for the researcher.
