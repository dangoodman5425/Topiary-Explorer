Use case 2

Want to be able to do a PCoA plot of the whole tree, want to drop some samples
from PCoA plot (drop 'bad' samples) want to make a new metadata column that describes
these outliers, figure out what taxa are in these outliers DROP samples completely
from the analysis (tree & PCoA) re-do PCoA and verify that you get different
clusters w/out those outliers

Want to take the initial PCoA and the tree, search for a certain lineage at a certain
level (genus) and then take just that subtree that belongs to that group and make
a new PCoA plot and compare it to the original, also need to be able to re-do original
PCoA based on samples which are present in the smaller PCoA but against the whole 
dataset
