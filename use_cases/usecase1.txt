Use case 1

Want to find what taxa are associated with a particular metadata field, ie, what
taxa are associated with particular people or what taxa are different between
different fingertips and keys within a given person, differences between left &
right hands.

Goals:

		to different levels
			-some blocks are common only to one person, some to more than one
			-want to name the blocks, what bacteria are there that are specific
				to one person
	2. Want to be able to export lists of names or subtrees that are specific
		to each of the people where we want to find the largest subtree that
		meets a consensus rule want to say "this person is enriched in this specific
		species"
